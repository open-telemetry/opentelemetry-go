# Experimental Features

The OTLP gRPC metric exporter contains features that have not yet stabilized in the OpenTelemetry specification.
These features are added to the OpenTelemetry Go OTLP exporters prior to stabilization in the specification so that users can start experimenting with them and provide feedback.

These features may change in backwards incompatible ways as feedback is applied.
See the [Compatibility and Stability](#compatibility-and-stability) section for more information.

## Features

- [Self-Observability](#self-observability)

### Self-Observability

The OTLP gRPC metric exporter can emit self-observability metrics to track its own operation.

This experimental feature can be enabled by setting the `OTEL_GO_X_SELF_OBSERVABILITY` environment variable.
The value must be the case-insensitive string of `"true"` to enable the feature.
All other values are ignored.

When enabled, the exporter will emit the following metrics using the global MeterProvider:

- `otel.sdk.exporter.metric_data_point.exported`: Counter tracking successfully exported data points
- `otel.sdk.exporter.metric_data_point.inflight`: UpDownCounter tracking data points currently being exported  
- `otel.sdk.exporter.operation.duration`: Histogram tracking export operation duration in seconds

All metrics include attributes identifying the exporter component and destination server:

- `otel.component.type`: Type of component (e.g., "otlp_grpc_metric_exporter")
- `otel.component.name`: Unique component instance name (e.g., "otlp_grpc_metric_exporter/0")
- `server.address`: Server hostname or address
- `server.port`: Server port number

#### Examples

Enable self-observability metrics.

```console
export OTEL_GO_X_SELF_OBSERVABILITY=true
```

Disable self-observability metrics.

```console
unset OTEL_GO_X_SELF_OBSERVABILITY
```

## Compatibility and Stability

Experimental features do not fall within the scope of the OpenTelemetry Go versioning and stability [policy](../../../../../../VERSIONING.md).
These features may be removed or modified in successive version releases, including patch versions.

When an experimental feature is promoted to a stable feature, a migration path will be included in the changelog entry of the release.
There is no guarantee that any environment variable feature flags that enabled the experimental feature will be supported by the stable version.
If they are supported, they may be accompanied with a deprecation notice stating a timeline for the removal of that support.
