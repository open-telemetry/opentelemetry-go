# Experimental Features

The Logs SDK contains features that have not yet stabilized.
These features are added to the OpenTelemetry Go Logs SDK prior to stabilization so that users can start experimenting with them and provide feedback.

These feature may change in backwards incompatible ways as feedback is applied.
See the [Compatibility and Stability](#compatibility-and-stability) section for more information.

## Compatibility and Stability

Experimental features do not fall within the scope of the OpenTelemetry Go versioning and stability [policy](../../../VERSIONING.md).
These features may be removed or modified in successive version releases, including patch versions.

When an experimental feature is promoted to a stable feature, a migration path will be included in the changelog entry of the release.
