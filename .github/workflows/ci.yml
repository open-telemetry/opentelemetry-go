  # Default version of Go to use by CI workflows. This should be the latest
  # release of Go; developers likely use the latest release in development and
  # we want to catch any bugs (e.g. lint errors, race detection) with this
  # release before they are merged. The Go compatibility guarantees ensure
  # backwards compatibility with the previous two minor releases and we
  # explicitly test our code for these versions so keeping this at prior
  # versions does not add value.
