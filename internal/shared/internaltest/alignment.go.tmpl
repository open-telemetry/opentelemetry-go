/*
This file contains common utilities and objects to validate memory alignment
of Go types. The primary use of this functionality is intended to ensure
`struct` fields that need to be 64-bit aligned so they can be passed as
arguments to 64-bit atomic operations.

The common workflow is to define a slice of `FieldOffset` and pass them to the
`Aligned8Byte` function from within a `TestMain` function from a package's
tests. It is important to make this call from the `TestMain` function prior
to running the rest of the test suit as it can provide useful diagnostics
about field alignment instead of ambiguous nil pointer dereference and runtime
panic.
